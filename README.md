## KOSMO Format Cat Distortion 

![](/IMG/Cat.jpg)

A KOSMO format of a PROCO Rat distortion pedal.

I love the PROCO RAT Distortion, so I adapted it for Synth DIY.

I’ve always loved the RAT, so I reworked it for Synth DIY. If you want the deep dive into how the circuit works, check out this excellent breakdown:

For this version, I swapped the original op-amp for a more common TL072. The clipping circuit also got an upgrade: the diodes were replaced with LEDs, which double as glowing cat eyes on the panel. They're actually part of the circuit, not just for show. Different colours will have different forward voltages and thus may effect the sound (although I haven't tested this).

Note: This was created by a hobbyist with no formal engineering training outside various late night YouTube binges. 
I’ve confirmed these designs to work but I make no guarantees on the design working efficiently.. or working at all.
